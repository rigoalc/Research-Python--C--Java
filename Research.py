Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. 
Its high-level built-in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, 
make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components. 
Python is simple, the easy-to-learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.
Was designed by: Guido van Rossum, and First appeared: February 20, 1991; 30 years ago.

C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system.
By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. C is highly portable and is used for scripting system applications 
which form a major part of Windows, UNIX, and Linux operating systems.
Was designed by: Dennis Ritchie, and was first created in 1972; 49 years ago.

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
Java is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms 
that support Java without the need for recompilation.
Was designed by: James Gosling, and was first created on May 23, 1995; 26 years ago.

In C code length is a bit lesser, 1.5 times less than JAVA. JAVA has quite a huge code. And with Python smaller code length, 3-4 times less than JAVA.
C Supports Operator overloading. JAVA Does not support Operator Overloading. Python Supports Operator overloading.
C Provide both single and multiple inheritances. JAVA Provides partial multiple inheritances using interfaces. Python Provide both single and multiple inheritances
C Functions and variables are used outside the class. JAVA Every bit of code is inside a class. Python Functions and variables can be declared and used outside the class also.
C program is a fast compiling programming language. JAVA Program compiler is a bit slower than C. For Python Due to the use of an interpreter execution is slower.

In Java, programs are not compiled into executable files; they are compiled into bytecode (as discussed earlier), which the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) then interprets/executes at runtime. 
Java source code is compiled into bytecode when we use the javac compiler.
C is what is called a compiled language. This means that once you write your C program, 
you must run it through a C compiler to turn your program into an executable that the computer can run (execute).
Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code of a Python program is converted into bytecode that is then executed by the Python virtual machine.

The difference between an interpreted and a compiled language lies in the result of the process of interpreting or compiling. 
An interpreter produces a result from a program, while a compiler produces a program written in assembly language.
In a compiled implementation, the original program is translated into native machine instructions, which are executed directly by the hardware.
In an interpreted implementation, the original program is translated into something else and another program, called "the interpreter" examines "something else" and performs whatever actions are called for.
